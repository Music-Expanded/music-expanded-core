    <description><![CDATA[This is free music for players to use alongside their favorite major overhauls / themes. 

Enjoy a bare bones Neolithic play style? Now you have a new soundtrack to immerse yourself further into the role play!

If you're like me and you use Androids and Glitterworld mods to make it as Sci-fi as possible, now we have a Glitterworld soundtrack!

Maybe you're going to stream a Fantasy playthrough on Twitch... you can play the Medieval / Fantasy soundtrack without worrying about copyright claims.]]>
