# Music Expanded - Core

TODO: This readme, and the rest of the owl.

## Buiding
`dotnet build` in the repository should built the assembly files.

## Dealing with Music files
As of right now things are hardcoded for Glitterworld. I'd like to keep the music tracks out of the repository if possible, to reduce size here. Eventually I'd like to programatially collect tracks so we don't need to do this manually, but pre-release this'll get us going.

Download the glitterworld tracks and place them into `Sounds/MusicExpanded/Glitterworld/`
